			<h2>Welcome! I am Jeremy Zoitas</h2>
			<p>
				I am a games programmer who has experience with c/c++, unity, and more which can be seen below. I have finished my Bacholer of games and virtual worlds(Programming) at AIE(Academy of Interactive Entertainment).
				Throughout my study I have gained experience in physics, graphics, AI, and audio programming.
				Most of these projects using C++ and some with C#(Unity). I have learned a lot about group projects and communication at AIE as we have done many game jams and major group projects.
				I love finding solutions to problems that I come across when programming and learning how to improve my work. I also find it refreshing to work with others to find solutions to problems or just discussing ideas with each other.

				<p>
					Otto is a third person platform that I worked on in my second year of university with six other people, two programmers, two designers, and two artists.
					We had 4-5 months to come up with an idea, create the technical design documents, pitch it and make a smooth experience with a functional gameplay loop.
					Some features got cut to account for over scoping, Which made it easier to focus on the important mechanics. 
					However this did not take away from project as it was only a demo which could be turned into a full game later on in the future if pursued.
					I have learned a lot from this project such as, a strong understanding of how to work effectively in a team, how to delegate tasks with others, and use a work flow such as scrum meetings which let us keep each other upto date and help one another.

			<h1>Digital Decent<span> - Unity</span></h1>
			<div class="Project-Content-Display">
				<p2>
					Digital Decent was my first ever group project. The concept of the game was to be a side scroller dungeon crawler that was procedurally generated.
					We over estimated what was needed to be done, as this was our first group project we thought we had more time,
					however this was disrupted by scource control corruptions early on as we figured out how to work together on a project as well as miss communication and team members leaving.
					Looking back I am happy how this turned out as it plays as intended and the menus works smoothly, although some features and gameplay could use some polishing.

					This was a game jam project that I created with a couple others. The game jam went for two and a half days and the theme was that the game had to be on mobile.
					So we decided to do an endless type game where you try and survive the longest and get the most kills. For the project I worked on the enemies, score, and the endless gameplay loop.
					I made use of object pooling with the enemies to hopefully make the game run well on mobile as that was one the concerns.
					I am pleased how this turned out however we only tested it on the mobile the last day and found that it ran poorly in spite of my efforts and needed optimization.

			<h1>Audio Visualizer<span> - C++ Application</span></h1>
			<div class="Project-Content-Display">
				<p2>
					This is a project which I made for an assignment which uses FMOD's low level API to display audio that is being played also known as a audio visualizer.
					Which can load music/audio files, play, pause, change the volume of the audio, and can change the intensitiy of the visuals.
					From completing this project I gained a wide experience and knowledge in audio programming especially using FMOD's low level API.

				<p2>
					This is a graphics engine which I created for uni loads in models from the code and renders them to the screen.
					It also includes a some shaders which have been put on some models and lights which effect the models and their visibility.
					It also includes a camera controller which can fly around the scene and rotate based of the mouse movement.

					For this project I was tasked with creating an app that can render 3D models, textures, and shaders.
					To do this I used GLFW(Graphics Library Framework) and glCore to help create scripts that can apply textures and shaders to objects, render objects in the scene, apply lighting, make partical emitters.
					I gained a lot of knowledge about what goes into graphics programming and how to create/use shaders, texture maps, rendering, lighting, and more.

			<h1>Unity Physics Demo<span> - Unity</span></h1>
			<div class="Project-Content-Display">
				<p2>
					This project was created to demonstrate an understanding of unity’s physics features and how to use them. 
					In the demo it involves a variety of features, such as a first person controller which has the ability to jump, crouch, and interact with objects,
					a little motorised slab, ragdoll slide, two wrecking balls one which uses joints and the other with springs, 
					Also a giant jenga tower which has different weighted objects that can be thrown at it.

				</figure>
				<p2>
					This application includes several different AI techniques. Each of the shapes have their own AI behavior.
					The two white squares in the graph path find using A* to move to the other side of the grid while avoiding the black squares then resetting and repeating.
					The blue square follows the mouse is on the screen and fleas from it when space bar is held down. The red circle seeks the mouse but avoids going through the centre.
					The yellow square randomly wanders around. Lastly the green square flees from the center of the application but can also be controlled using WASD.
					From this assignment I've learned a lot about pathfinding algorithms including AI and their diffrent AI behaviour states which I think about whenever I create AI today.

			<h1>FPS Character Controller<span> - Unity</span></h1>
			<div class="Project-Content-Display">
				<p2>
					I completed this project in my third year of university, I was required to make game component or system that could be sold or distributed to help others.
					I chose to do a first person character controller which had a variety of features that could be toggled on or off to help create a controller that would fit the users needs.
					In the end it had the ability to sprint, slide, crouch, prone, strafe, bunny hop, shoot, walk, and more.
					Overall the controller could be used for fast or slow paced games however I focused too much time on getting strafing and bunny hopping to work that I missed out on features such as leaning around corners, etc.
					From this experience I leaned a lot about character controllers, how they all differ and how many features it would take to make a universal fpscc.

				</figure>
				<p2>
					This program tests different Spatial Partitioning techniques against each other in Unity, for example it tests the naive approach to a k-dtree.
					It does so by using a group of AI that walk into each other and looks for the closest opposite color.
					This project was created to aid a resarch paper I needed to write. The purpose was to see how much spatial partitioning techniques make a difference.
					To do so I created a k-dTree and used a QuadTree to test the framerate differences. From my findings it improved to performence by about seven times.
					Overall this project turned out great I learned a lot about spatial partitioning and how to optimise a real time stratergy game with hundreds of AI on the battlefield,
