			<h2>Welcome! I am Jeremy Zoitas</h2>
			<p>
				I am a games programmer who has experience with c/c++, unity, and more which can be found on my about page. I am currently working on finishing my Bacholer of games and virtual worlds at AIE(Academy of Interactive Entertainment).
				I have some experience in physics programming, graphics programming, AI programming, and little audio programming. Throughout my study I have gained experience in physics programming, graphics programming, AI programming,
				a little audio programming, and general C++ programing knowledge. I have learned a lot about group projects and communication at AIE as we have done many game jams and major group projects.
				I love finding solutions to problems that I come across when programming and learning how to improve my work. I also find it refreshing to work with others to find solutions to problems or just discussing ideas with each other

					Otto is a 3D platformer which I worked on for my major project of my course. Throughout the project the team learned a lot about developing a platformer and how much work and difficult it is to get the game feeling smooth.
					We learned that the movement had to feel smooth which ended up being the main focus of the mechanics. Overall I am happy with how the project ended up as we had about 4-5 months to come up with an idead pitch it and complete it as a functional game, we cut back on a couple fetaures from what we first planned as we did not want to over scope.
					Although some fetaures had been cut it did not take away from the main purpose of the project which was more so to be a demo of the platformer Otto which could be turned into a full game later on in the future if pursued.

					This is a game that myself and a couple others made for a game jam. The game jam went for two and a half days and the theme was that the game had to be on mobile.
					So we decided to do an endless type game where you try and survive the longest and get the most kill.
					I am pleased how this turned out however we only tested it on the mobile the last day and found that it ran poorly and needed optimization.

			<h1>Audio Visualizer<span> - C++ Application</span></h1>
			<div class="Project-Content-Display">
				<p2>
					This is a project which I made for an assignment it uses FMOD's low level API to display audio that is being played.
					This is called an audio visualizer it which can load music/audio files, play, pause, change the volume of the audio, and can change the intensitiy of the visuals.

					This is a graphics engine which I created for uni loads in models from the code and renders them to the screen.
					It also includes a some shaders which have been put on some models and lights which effect the models and their visibility.
					It also includes a camera controller which can fly around the scene and rotate based of the mouse movement.

					This is a little demo which I made to represent the type of physics that unity can do.
					It involves a variety of things happening for example joints being used to make a wrecking ball type mechanism,
					a giant stack of jenga which can be knocked over,
					a ragdoll which is being tossed down a slide, and different weights in the blocks to demonstrate different forces that can happen to them.
					It also includes a first person character controller which I made that push objects away with the mouse click, jumping around,
					and a can crouch under blocks and not uncrouch while there is something above it.

					This application includes several different AI techniques. Each of the shapes does their own AI behavior.
					The two white squares in the graph path find using A* to get the their positions on the graph avoiding the black squares.
					The blue square follows where ever the mouse is on the screen. The red square follows the blue square around but it avoids the center point of the application.
					The yellow square just wanders around. Lastly the blue square also flees from the center of the application when the space bar is held down.
